### What Equipment Do I Need?
When you come into class the first day, all you need is yourself and some loose-fitting clothing like you might normally wear to work out.  We can provide you with sticks, pads, or anything you might need for class that day while you're just beginning.

If you want to stick with it (no pun intended), you'll eventually want to get your own equipment.  You don't need everything right away, but eventually you'll want to have:
- Two pairs of rattan kali/escrima/arnis sticks
- Training knife
- Hockey gloves
- Boxing gloves (16 oz. is best)
- MMA gloves
- Training bolo
- Protective sparring headgear (preferably with a level of face protection - fencing headger also works)
- Groin protector
- Water bottle
- Notebook and pen

### Where Do I Get This Stuff?
Well, some of it is a little more common than others.

In the Kansas City area, there's [Oddessy Martial Arts Supply](http://oddessy.com/) over in Raytown if you want to buy the gear in person.  You might check with them before going over there to make sure they have what you want in stock.

Online, you can buy virtually all of these things from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2AVt5WJ), which is where I go to buy the basic protective gear.  I personally prefer the Everlast brand of gear.

For weapons, the [Kali Center](https://www.kalicenter.com/gear.html) sells good quality sticks and training weapons.  My favorite pair of sticks ever, I got from the [Dog Brothers](https://dogbrothersgear.com/tools-of-the-trade/).

If none of the above gets you what you're after, [I&I Sports](https://iisports.com/) also has a wide stock of good equipment.
